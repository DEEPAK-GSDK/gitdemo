Given a string k consisting of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same
character. For example, a string like K = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z" and "yy".
A group is called large if it has 3 or more characters. Your task is to return the starting and ending positions of every large group.

Implement a Java code based on the following specifications. Note that your code should match the specifications in a precise manner. Consider default visibility of classes, data fields and methods unless mentioned otherwise.

Specifications:

class Source:
method definitons:
 printPositions(String K): Method to return the starting and ending positions of every large group.
 return type: List<List<Integer>>
 visibilty: public
 
addAfter(ArrayList<String> a, String m, String n): Method to add string n at the position next to the position of string element m in the list.
 return type: ArrayList<String>
 visibility: public

Task:
Create a Source class and implement below given method:

- printPositions(String K): Method to return the starting and ending positions of every large group.
- addAfter(ArrayList<String> a, String m, String n): Method to add string n at the position next to the position of string element m in the list.(Hint: Add n after every occurrence of m in a)

Algorithm:

printPositions(String K):
- Maintain pointers i, j with i <= j. The i pointer will represent the start of the current group, and we will increment j forward until it reaches the end of the group.
- We know that we have reached the end of the group when j is at the end of the string, or S[j] != S[j 1]. At this point, we have some group [i, j]; and after, we will update i = j+1, the start of the next group.


Sample Input:
mousssssseeee
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("ad");
list.add("cc");
list.add("df");
list.add("ez");
m = cc, n = kc;

Sample Output:
[[3, 8], [9, 12]]
[ad, cc, kc, df, ez]

Explanation:
- In the above example the string "kc" denoted by string n is placed at position next to position of string "cc" denoted by string m.
