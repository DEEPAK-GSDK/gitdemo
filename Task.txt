Your task here is to implement a Java code based on the following specifications. Note that your code
should match the specifications in a precise manner. Consider default visibility of classes, data fields and
methods unless mentioned otherwise.

class definitions:
class TransactionParty:
	Variables:
		String seller
		String buyer
	Implement a Constructor using the class variables.

class Receipt:
	Variables:
		TransactionParty transactionParty
		String productsQR
	Implement a Constructor using the class variables.

class GenerateReceipt:
	method definitions:
	
	calcGST(Receipt r): extract the rate and quantity of the products from input string and calculate GST @12%
	Return type: String
	Visibility: public

In this method, you have to use the productsQR variable of the Receipt r object to extract the Quantity and Rate of 3 products.

The variable productsQR will have a string value of the format <Rate>,<Quantity>@<Rate>,<Quantity>@<Rate>,<Quantity>

Rate is the price rate of the product
Quantity is the number of units bought
	e.g: productsQR = "250,10@100,3@50,7" has the Rate as 250, 100 and 50 while Quantity as 10, 3 and 7 respectively.

Use the GST_Rate as 12%.
Calculate the value of GST using the formula:
	GST = (Rate1 * Quantity1 + Rate2 * Quantity2 + Rate3 * Quantity3) * GST_Rate
